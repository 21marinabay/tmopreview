        <p>Replacement  Policy</p>
        <p><BR>
        </p>
        <p>We only  offer replacements in the following circumstances:</p>
        <p><BR>
        </p>
        <p>1. 	The  fabric or accessories selected by you are not available. Some of the  fabrics and accessories offered within our selection are only  available whilst stocks last. We do not guarantee the availability of  all our fabrics and accessories upon placing an order, in particular  for our seasonal fabric selections. We will inform you as soon as we  can in the event that any fabric or accessories selected by you are  not available. You may then wish to modify your order or seek a full  refund. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>2. 	If the  shirt shipped to you does not fit because the measurements of the  shirt varies from the specification stated in the order sheet. </p>
        <p><BR>
        </p>
        <p>3.	The  chosen fabric does not match with the received fabrics. Please note  that actual fabric color can vary between 5-10% when viewed on  screen. Differences due to screen resolution are not considered for  replacement. </p>
        <p><BR>
        </p>
        <p>Should any  of these circumstances occur, simply contact us within 30 days upon  receiving the shirt at <a href="mailto:customerservice@tailormeonline.com">customerservice@tailormeonline.com</a>.  Instructions will be given on how to mail the shirt back to us [and  we will send a replacement ]. (PW: Do you want to have a verification  process first to make sure that it&rsquo;s a valid refund case before  sending a replacement?) TailorMeOnline will bear the cost of shipping  the shirt back to us. All returns must be unworn and with tags and  labels intact Shirts that have been washed, worn or stained will not  be accepted for refunds.</p>
        <p><BR>
        </p>
        <p>It is  important to note that the measurements included on the profile are  body measurements, not garment sizes. Based on the measurements taken  from your profile, our tailors will make the necessary adjustments  for movement according to the fit selected by you. Therefore, body  measurements cannot be compared with garment measures in order to  identify possible deviations.</p>

        <p>Shirts  made by TailorMeOnline are always tailored in accordance with the  measurements specified by you. If you have selected to provide your  own body measurements, your shirt is matched to the fit chosen by you  â€“ Slim or Regular. If you select measurements taken from an  existing shirt, the dimensions of your new shirt will match those of  your old shirt. However, we cannot warrant that the two shirts will  be identical in the run of the seams and design. Please note that  adjustments in size of up to 1 cm may be necessary. We do not  guarantee that the pieces ordered by you from the standard sizes of  our tables will offer a perfect fit. </p>

In  such events, the customer may be entitled for a full refund and  TailorMeOnline may be entitled to not deliver the products.  TailorMeOnline considers war, terrorism, changes to legislations,  transportation failures and obstructions, failure of on-time  deliveries from suppliers to TailorMeOnline, strikes, natural  catastrophes, and any other events or circumstances that are beyond  our control as force majeure. </p>
